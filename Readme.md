# Hand Sign Detection System

This project is a Python-based hand sign detection system designed for exploring and learning computer vision techniques. It leverages libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time. The system can be used as a foundation for applications such as gesture-based controls or sign language recognition.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking.
- Recognition of basic hand signs.
- Easy-to-understand code for learning purposes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script and interact with the system using hand gestures.
