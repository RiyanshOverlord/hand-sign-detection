✋ Hand Sign Detection System
A real-time hand gesture detection system built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This project is designed as an educational tool for learning core computer vision techniques, and serves as a foundational base for more advanced applications like gesture-controlled interfaces or sign language recognition.

📌 Features
📹 Real-Time Hand Tracking: Detects and tracks hands from live webcam feed using MediaPipe.

🤚 Basic Hand Sign Recognition: Recognizes simple gestures based on hand landmarks.

🧑‍💻 Beginner-Friendly Code: Clean and modular code structure ideal for learning and experimentation.

📦 Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the following libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
